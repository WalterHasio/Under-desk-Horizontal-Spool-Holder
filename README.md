Filament spool holder that can be mounted under a desk, holds the spool horizontally.  The top plate is attached to the bottom of the desk using screws or double sided tape.  The lower holder goes through the spool and snaps magnetically to the top plate.  The lower part and spool rotates around the thrust bearing.

There are two different spool posts, a short version that works with most narrow spools or spools with an inset (e.g. Atomic Filament), and a longer version that works with most spools, including the wider ones.

Uses a 14mm thrust bearing* and 15mm magnets*.  I used 3 magnets on top and 5 on the bottom, that should be strong enough for 1kg spools, but more can be used for a more secure attachment.  The magnets are pressed into the plastic using crush ribs, the thrust bearing is held in by the magnets.
